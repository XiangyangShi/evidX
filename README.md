# Evidence Extraction Project (evidX)

Currently, this is a high-level placeholder project for wiki-based documentation about Evidence Extraction work being performed at ISI. This work was funded by DARPA Big Mechanism program under ARO contract W911NF-14-1-0436. We have also received NIH funding under project 1R01LM012592-01 ('Evidence Extraction Systems for the Molecular Interaction Literature'). 

Our primary focus in this project is to maintain a [wiki](https://github.com/SciKnowEngine/evidX/wiki) to act as a laboratory notebook for this project.
