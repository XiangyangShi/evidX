This week I try an algorithm to split subimages.

Images extracted from pdfs usually has the similar fonts:
  Usually a specific conference named a standards for all the formats.

What we shall do is:
1. find the coordinates (X,Y) of the tags which is used to mark the subimages.
2. find an algorithm to split images according to coordinates we get.

Step 1.
We can use different sizes of flipping windows to move inside the wholeImage.
And then we utilize model recognition methods to match all windows we get.
In my demo I just count the sum of differences from 2 pixles.
Find the window with the greatest similarity with our model "A""B"or"C"
Note the coordinates for the window.
Repeat this process again.

Step 2.
For a specific group of coordinates, we have serveral different layouts of grids, even in different orders.
I want to extract from the last to first.
Each time we extract last subimage ( square area from (x,y) to (wholeImage.maxX,wholeImage.maxY) ) , and replace it with blank.
When we get the next subimage, it may contain the blank area we just filled.
We can cut the margin (which only contain white pixels).

It seems Step2 works very well in most cases. 
Only some extrem sceneary can cause problems, but the result still make sense to some extend.e 
The accuracy is no better than 30%
### The main problem comes from the slow process of Step1.
I guess deeplearning methods can be faster and more accurate.

I shall extract a dataset for trainging an OCR next week.
Huai Gu gives me an approachable way to train OCR, I may try later and talked to Rex.
